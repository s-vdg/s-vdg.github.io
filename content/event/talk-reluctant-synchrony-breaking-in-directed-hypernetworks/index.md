title: "Talk: Reluctant Synchrony Breaking in Directed Hypernetworks"
abstract: Interconnected real-world systems oftentimes contain non-pairwise
  interactions between agents referred to as higher order interactions.
  Countless works in recent years have highlighted how this structural feature
  crucially shapes the collective behavior. The higher order interaction
  structure can be encoded by means of a hypergraph or hypernetwork. This talk
  will focus on dynamics of such hypernetworks. We observe that simple model
  equations give rise to obstructions to the design of some heteroclinic
  structures in phase space when the interactions are undirected, whereas their
  directed counterparts do not. This leads us to define a very general class of
  directed hypernetworks and corresponding maps that respect a given interaction
  structure, so-called admissible maps. For this class, all robust patterns of
  (cluster) synchrony that a given hypernetwork supports can be classified.
  Interestingly, these are only determined by higher degree polynomial
  admissible maps. In particular, unlike in classical networks, cluster
  synchronization is a higher order, i.e., nonlinear effect. This feature
  induces a novel type of “reluctant” synchrony breaking bifurcation when a high
  order tangency of the solution branch to a non-robust synchrony space causes
  formerly synchronous nodes to separate unusually slowly as exemplified in the
  figure.
