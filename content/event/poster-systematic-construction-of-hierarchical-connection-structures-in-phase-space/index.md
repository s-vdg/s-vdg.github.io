title: "Poster: Systematic construction of hierarchical connection structures in
  phase space"
abstract: >-
  We provide a method to systematically construct vector fields that possess
  excitable transitions corresponding to a desired hierarchical connection
  structure. The structure is given as a finite set of digraphs $G_1,...,G_N$
  (the lower level), together with another digraph $Gamma$ on the set of nodes
  $1,...,N$ (the top level). The dynamic realizations of $G_1,...,G_N$ are
  heteroclinic networks and they can be thought of as individual connection
  patterns on a given set of states. Connections in $\Gamma$ correspond to
  transitions between these different connection patterns. In our construction,
  the connections given through $\Gamma$ are not heteroclinic, but excitable
  with zero threshold: such a connection exists between two sets $S,S'$ if in
  every $\delta$-neighbourhood of $S$ there is at least one initial condition
  such that its $omega$-limit is contained in $S'$. In this sense, we prove a
  theorem that allows the systematic creation of hierarchical networks that are
  excitable on the top level, and heteroclinic on the lower level. Our results
  modify and extend the simplex method by Ashwin & Postlethwaite, which is one
  of several existing techniques for the construction of vector fields that
  possess a desired heteroclinic network.
