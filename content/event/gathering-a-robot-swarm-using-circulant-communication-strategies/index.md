title: Gathering a robot swarm using circulant communication strategies
abstract: We investigate the behavior of a swarm of autonomous, mobile robots
  moving in the plane. Robots observe positions of their neighbors according to
  a circulant interaction network and adapt their movement in order to gather in
  a single point. Using methods from continuous dynamical systems theory, we
  uncover conditions on the adaptation laws to guarantee gathering will be
  reached as well as a hierarchy of initial configurations of robot's positions
  in terms of convergence speed.
