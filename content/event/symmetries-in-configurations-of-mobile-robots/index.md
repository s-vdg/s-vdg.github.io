title: Analyzing Symmetries of Swarms of Mobile Robots Using Equivariant Dynamics
abstract: >-
  A commonly investigated problem in distributed computing is the general
  pattern formation (GPF) problem: A swarm of simple autonomous, disoriented
  robots must form a predefined planar pattern. This task is to be solved by the
  robots autonomously, i. e., without being controlled externally but instead by
  performing individual computations based on the observation of the other
  robots' positions. The strategy that each robot pursues is called a
  (distributed) protocol. It is well-known, that the distributed nature of the
  model induces limitations on the patterns that can be formed. In particular,
  if the initial configuration of the robots has a certain (rotational) symmetry
  the reachable target patterns necessarily have this symmetry as well. The only
  known algorithm to form large patterns with limited perception range and
  without memory requires the robots to first move closely together, referred to
  as near-gathering. Common protocols that solve this (partial) task, however,
  increase the symmetries of the robot swarm which in turn reduces the number of
  target patterns that can be realized eventually.

  Here, we demonstrate how the collective dynamics of a robot swarm can be modelled conveniently in the language of dynamical systems. These mathematical models naturally come with certain equivariance (i. e., symmetry) properties which can be exploited to study the effect of the an algorithm on the symmetries of the swarm. We derive a condition on a general protocol under which the increase of symmetries is impossible. Then, we introduce two example protocols which satisfy this condition. Both induce non-trivial collective dynamics and at least partly solve the near-gathering problem without increasing symmetries of the swarm.
