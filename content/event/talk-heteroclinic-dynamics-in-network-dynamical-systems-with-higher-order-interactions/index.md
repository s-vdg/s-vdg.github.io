title: "Talk: Heteroclinic dynamics in network dynamical systems with
  higher-order interactions"
abstract: "Interconnected real-world systems oftentimes contain non-pairwise
  interactions between agents referred to as higher order interactions.
  Countless works in recent years have highlighted how this structural feature
  crucially shapes the collective behavior. We analyse whether heteroclinic
  structures can arise in network dynamics with higher-order interactions. In
  particular, we investigate under which conditions two well-known heteroclinic
  constructions can be realized in a corresponding network dynamical system. We
  find that commonly analysed model equations such as network dynamics on
  undirected hypergraphs induce homogeneity in the equations of motion which
  give rise to obstructions to the design of heteroclinic structures in phase
  space. By contrast, directed hypergraphs break the homogeneity and lead to
  vector fields that support heteroclinic structures. "
