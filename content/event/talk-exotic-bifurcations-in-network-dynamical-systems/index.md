title: "Talk: Exotic bifurcations in network dynamical systems"
abstract: >-
  Many dynamical systems in fields such as neuroscience (the workings of the
  brain), systems biology (metabolic systems) and robotics (robot swarms)
  exhibit the structure of a network: they consist of nodes (neurons, proteins,
  robots) with connections between them. The specific structure of these
  interactions can produce remarkable dynamics beyond that of the individual
  nodes. Prominent examples include synchronization and highly complex branching
  behavior in bifurcations, phenomena that are not found in dynamical systems
  without the structure of a network.


  Network dynamical systems are not well understood mathematically, which makes it hard to quantify and control their behavior. The reason is that most of the established machinery of dynamical systems theory fails to distinguish between networks and general dynamical systems. Several mathematical tools that are tailor-made for network problems have been proposed recently. Strikingly, they have one thing in common: they exploit the algebraic nature of networks.


  In this talk, I will give an overview over some recent results regarding the question which dynamical behavior and generic bifurcations are dictated by the network structure of a system. In particular, I will illustrate how structural and algebraic properties culminate in symmetries of the governing equations and how these can be exploited for (partial) answers. This includes classical symmetries but also more exotic concepts such as monoid and quiver representations.
