title: "Talk: Intriguing dynamics on hypergraphs: a focus on directed higher
  order interactions"
abstract: In real-world complex systems, agents are oftentimes interacting in
  groups rather than in pairs. These interactions are referred to as higher
  order interactions and can be encoded by means of hypergraphs or
  hypernetworks. Countless works in recent years have pointed out how this
  structural feature crucially shapes the collective behavior. This talk will,
  in particular, focus on dynamics of systems with higher order interactions. We
  observe that simple model equations on an undirected hypergraph obstruct the
  emergence of certain heteroclinic structures in phase space. The directed
  counterparts, on the other hand, do not. Motivated by this, we define a
  general class of directed hypernetworks and corresponding maps that respect a
  given interaction structure, so-called admissible maps. For this class, all
  robust patterns of (cluster) synchrony that a given hypernetwork supports can
  be classified. Interestingly, these are only determined by higher degree
  polynomial admissible maps. In particular, unlike in classical networks,
  cluster synchronization is a higher order, i.e., nonlinear effect. This
  feature induces a novel type of “reluctant” synchrony breaking bifurcation
  when a high order tangency of the solution branch to a non-robust synchrony
  space causes formerly synchronous nodes to separate unusually slowly.
