title: "Minisymposium: Dynamics of and on Networks with Varying Topologies"
abstract: >-
  Many real-world systems display network structure consisting of individual
  units which interact. Typically, complex interaction topologies and the
  resulting high dimensionality cause issues for the investigation of collective
  dynamics of coupled systems. In recent years, many approaches have been
  developed to tackle these issues. Predominantly, these focus on static
  interaction structures.


  In applications, however, frequently also the connections vary. Examples range from neuroscience (active and inactive communication channels) over epidemiology (time-dependent social interactions allow for transmissions) to robotics and distributed computing (individual mobile robots communicate only when they are in each others vicinity). From the dynamical systems perspective such varying networks are much less studied. Difficulties arise on two sides: besides the complicated dynamics of interacting agents also structural properties are subject to variations and have to be investigated. In the analysis of dynamics of and on networks with varying topologies, these challenges congregate and require combined methods from network dynamics and graph theory.


  In view of the growing importance of the field, this minisymposium highlights recent development from both perspectives in an attempt to connect respective experts: Talks focus on the application of dynamical systems methods to evolving networks as well as on collective dynamics of systems subject to varying coupling structures.
