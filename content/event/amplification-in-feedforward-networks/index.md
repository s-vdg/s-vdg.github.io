title: Amplification in feedforward networks
abstract: "We investigate bifurcations in feedforward coupled cell networks. The
  feedforward structure can be defined very generally in multiple ways: It is
  characterized by the absence of feedback, a partial order on the cells, the
  structure of the adjecancy matrices, as well as the algebraic properties of
  the input maps. We exploit the interplay of these definitions to study generic
  one-parameter steady state bifurcations for such networks. Branching solutions
  can be determined by an algorithm that only utilizes the network structure.
  Similar to previous results on feedforward chains, we observe amplifications
  of the growth rates of steady state branches induced by the feedforward
  structure. Branching solutions and their asymptotics are described in terms of
  Taylor coefficients of the internal dynamics. Contrary to the earlier results,
  as the interaction scenarios can be more complicated in general feedforward
  networks, different branching patterns and different amplifications can occur
  for different regions in the space of Taylor coefficients."
