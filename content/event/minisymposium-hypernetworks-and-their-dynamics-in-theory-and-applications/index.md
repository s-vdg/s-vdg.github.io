title: "Minisymposium: Hypernetworks and their dynamics in theory and applications"
abstract: Collective dynamics of interacting units are prevalent in nature and
  engineering, whether it is neurons in the brain or opinion building in social
  networks. Recently, there has been tremendous interest in simultaneous
  interactions between three or more units, so-called higher-order interactions.
  The drive comes from various disciplines, for example ecology, where
  simultaneous competition for resources of multiple species causes
  nonstationary fluctuations of species abundancies. Such advances suggest to
  model the underlying structures by hypernetworks represented by hypergraphs.
  This minisymposium displays recent models in real-world applications and
  theoretical studies on hypernetwork dynamics to highlight development and
  connect experts from both communities.
