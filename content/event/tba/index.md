title: Strange symmetries and strange bifurcations in network dynamical systems
abstract: >-
  Many dynamical systems in fields such as neuroscience (the workings of the
  brain), systems biology (metabolic systems) and robotics (robot swarms)
  exhibit the structure of a network: they consist of nodes (neurons, proteins,
  robots) with connections between them. It usually does not suffice to
  understand the nature of the individual nodes to deduce the behavior of the
  network, as the specific interaction structure of a network can produce
  remarkable dynamics. Prominent examples include synchronization (e.g., the
  simultaneous firing of neurons) and highly complex branching behavior in
  bifurcations, phenomena that are not found in dynamical systems without the
  structure of a network.


  Network dynamical systems are not well understood mathematically, which makes it hard to quantify and control their behavior. The reason is that most of the established machinery of dynamical systems theory fails to distinguish between networks and general dynamical systems. Thus, we need mathematical tools that are tailor-made for network problems. Several techniques have been proposed recently, and they strikingly have one thing in common: they exploit the algebraic nature of networks. 


  In this talk, I will give an overview over some recent results regarding the question which dynamical behavior and generic bifurcations are dictated by the network structure of a system. In particular, I will illustrate how structural and algebraic properties culminate in symmetries of the governing equations and how these can be exploited for (partial) answers. This includes classical symmetries but also more exotic concepts such as monoid and quiver representations.
