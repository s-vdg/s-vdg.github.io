  I will be at the XLIV Dynamics Days Europe in Bremen.


  Dynamics Days Europe is a series of major international conferences founded in the 1980â€™s that provides a European forum for developments in the theory and applications of dynamics. For more than 40 years, it has been bringing together researchers from a wide range of backgrounds including physics, mathematics, biology, and engineering for interdisciplinary research in nonlinear science.
