abstract: >
  I will participate in the (digital) workshop COUPLED 80.


  The COUPLED 80 WORKSHOP will take on October 09th â€“ October 10th 2025, in ONLINE MODE.


  This conference is dedicated to the excellent Mathematicians who turn 80 years old in 2025, namely Professor Mike Field (Houston University, USA), Professor Martin Golubitsky (Ohio State University, USA), Professor John Guckenheimer (Cornell University, USA), Professor Phil Holmes (Princeton University, USA) and Professor Ian Stewart (University of Warwick, UK).


  Its aim is to bring together mathematicians and theoretical scientists from a variety of fields to exchange ideas on the behavior of structured networks of interacting dynamical systems. It also serves as an introduction and overview of the applications and theory of coupled dynamical systems for the graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who may want to join the Workshop.


  The workshop is designed to maximize the involvement of all participants and will present the state-of-the-art research and the latest achievements.


  Main topics include:

  - nonlinear dynamics and bifurcation theory;

  - role of symmetry in the formation of patterns in physical systems;

  - role of network architecture in the dynamics of coupled systems;

  - mathematical aspects of biological applications: animal gaits, the visual cortex, homeostasis, and coupled systems.

  - etc.
