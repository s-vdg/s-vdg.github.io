title: "Talk: Homogeneous Coupled Cell Systems with High-dimensional Internal
  Dynamics"
abstract: >-
  We investigate homogeneous coupled cell systems with high-dimensional internal
  dynamics. In many studies on network dynamics, the analysis is restricted to
  networks with one-dimensional internal dynamics. Here, we show how symmetry
  explains the relation between dynamical behavior of systems with
  one-dimensional internal dynamics and with higher dimensional internal
  dynamics, when the underlying network topology is the same. Fundamental
  networks of homogeneous coupled cell systems (compare to [1]) can be expressed
  in terms of monoid representations, which uniquely decompose into
  indecomposable subrepresentations. In the high-dimensional internal dynamics
  case, these subrepresentations are isomorphic to multiple copies of those one
  computes in the one-dimensional internal dynamics case. This has interesting
  implications for possible center subspaces in bifurcation analysis. We
  describe the effect on steady state and Hopf bifurcations in l-parameter
  families of network vector fields.  The main results in that regard are that
  (1) generic one-parameter steady state bifurcations are qualitatively
  independent of the dimension of the internal dynamics and that, (2) in order
  to observe all generic l-parameter bifurcations, the internal dynamics has to
  be at least l-dimensional for steady state bifurcations and 2l-dimensional for
  Hopf bifurcations. Furthermore, we illustrate how additional structure in the
  network can be exploited to obtain even greater understanding of bifurcation
  scenarios in the high-dimensional case beyond qualitative statements about the
  collective dynamics. One-parameter steady state bifurcations in feedforward
  networks exhibit an unusual amplification in the asymptotic growth rates of
  individual cells [2]. As another main result, we prove that (3) the same cells
  exhibit this amplifying effect with the same growth rates when the internal
  dynamics is high-dimensional.
