title: "Minisymposium: Patterns in networked systems: theory and applications"
abstract: >-
  From the synchronized firing of neurons in the brain to the spread of opinions
  in social networks, the collective dynamics of individual units plays a
  crucial role in shaping the behavior of complex systems. Mathematically, such
  networks of interacting agents can be modeled by coupled ordinary differential
  equations, or, when focusing on the collective behavior, by partial
  differential equations. The analysis of patterns on the network, such as
  (partially) synchronized behavior, chimeras or spatio-temporal patterns, can
  give insight in the emergent phenomena of the modeled situation; for example,
  specific activity patterns neuron models correspond to healthy or pathological
  brain behavior. 


  This two-part minisymposium aims to highlight recent developments in patterns on networks, with a particular focus on the connection between more theoretical and more applied approaches. Thematically, the minisymposium will focus on i) phase equations and phase synchronisation in network dynamical systems and ii) combinatorial network dynamics, with for both of these topics an explicit emphasis on connections to mathematical neuroscience. By exploring the intricate relationships between patterns, dynamics, and applications, this minisymposium seeks to inspire new insights and innovations in the study of collective dynamics.
