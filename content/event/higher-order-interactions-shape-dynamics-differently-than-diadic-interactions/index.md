title: Higher order interactions shape dynamics differently than diadic interactions
abstract: Many real-world interconnected systems are governed by non-pairwise
  interactions between agents frequently referred to as higher order
  interactions. The resulting higher order interaction structure can be encoded
  by means of a hypergraph or hypernetwork. This talk will focus on dynamics of
  such hypernetworks. We define a class of maps that respects the higher order
  interaction structure, so-called admissible maps, and investigate how robust
  patterns of synchrony can be classified. Interestingly, these are only defined
  by higher degree polynomial admissible maps. This means that, unlike in
  classical networks, cluster synchronization on hypernetworks is a higher
  order, i.e., nonlinear effect. This feature has further implications for the
  dynamics. In particular, it causes the phenomenon of ``reluctant synchrony
  breaking'' on hypernetworks, which occurs when bifurcating solutions lie close
  to a non-robust synchrony space.
