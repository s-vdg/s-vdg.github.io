title: "Workshop participation: Dynamics in Coupled Network Systems"
abstract: >-
  The dynamics of coupled oscillators plays an important role in a variety of
  systems in nature and technology. The workshop will bring together
  mathematicians and experts from various fields of applications (neuronal
  systems, power grids, chemical oscillations) to discuss recent developments
  and further perspectives from an interdisciplinary perspective. A specific
  focus will be on:

  - adaptive networks

  - structured networks: symmetries and beyond

  - emergent collective dynamics

  - heterogeneous networks and homogenization

  - networks with multiple time scale dynamics
location: Weierstraß-Institut für angewandte Analysis und Stochastik, Berlin
