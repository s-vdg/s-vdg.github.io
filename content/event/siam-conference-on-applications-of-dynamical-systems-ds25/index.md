title: "Minisymposium: Dynamics of Higher-order Interaction Networks: Theory and
  Applications"
abstract: Collective dynamics of interacting units is prevalent in nature and
  engineering. Examples include neurons in the brain or opinion building in
  social networks. Recently, there has been significant interest in simultaneous
  interactions between three or more units, so-called higher-order interactions.
  On the one hand, such interactions provide natural generalizations of dynamics
  on graphs. On the other hand, they also arise indirectly, for example, as
  phase interactions in oscillatory dynamics. The structure of higher-order
  interaction networks, or hypernetworks, are typically captured by hypergraphs.
  Hence, it is critical to understand how the structural network properties
  affect the dynamics and the implications for applications. This minisymposium
  will feature recent advances on higher-order interaction networks from a
  theoretical and applied point of view. The first part of the minisymposium
  will focus on higher-order interactions in networks of coupled oscillators.
  The second part of the minisymposium will focus on more general models and
  results, ranging from chemical reaction networks to general dynamics on
  simplicial complexes.
