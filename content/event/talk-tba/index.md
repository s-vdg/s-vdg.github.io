title: "Talk: Higher order interactions cause exotic dynamics, especially
  directed ones"
abstract: Interconnected real-world systems oftentimes contain non-pairwise
  interactions between agents. These groupwise interactions are referred to as
  higher order interactions and can be encoded by means of hypergraphs or
  hypernetworks. Countless works in recent years have pointed out how this
  structural feature crucially shapes the collective behavior. This talk will,
  in particular, focus on dynamics of systems with higher order interactions. We
  observe that the restriction to undirected higher order interactions obstructs
  the emergence of certain heteroclinic structures in phase space. The directed
  counterparts, on the other hand, do not. Motivated by this, we define a
  general class of directed hypernetworks and corresponding maps that respect a
  given interaction structure, so-called admissible maps. For this class, all
  robust patterns of (cluster) synchrony that a given hypernetwork supports can
  be classified. Interestingly, these are only determined by higher degree
  polynomial admissible maps. In particular, unlike in classical networks,
  cluster synchronization is a higher order, that is, nonlinear effect. This
  feature induces a novel type of “reluctant” synchrony breaking bifurcation
  when a high order tangency of the solution branch to a non-robust synchrony
  space causes formerly synchronous nodes to separate unusually slowly.
