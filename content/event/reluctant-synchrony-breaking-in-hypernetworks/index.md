title: "Talk: Reluctant synchrony breaking in hypernetworks"
abstract: "Interconnected real-world systems oftentimes contain non-pairwise
  interactions between agents referred to as higher order interactions.
  Countless works in recent years have highlighted how this structural feature
  crucially shapes the collective behavior. The collective higher order
  interaction structure can be encoded by means of a hypergraph or hypernetwork.
  This talk will focus on dynamics of such hypernetworks. We define a class of
  maps that respects the higher order interaction structure, so-called
  admissible maps, and investigate how robust patterns of synchrony can be
  classified. Interestingly, these are only defined by higher degree polynomial
  admissible maps. This is in stark contrast to classical diadic networks where
  robust synchrony is governed by the linear admissible maps. Therefore, cluster
  synchronization on hypernetworks is truely a higher order, i.e., nonlinear
  effect. This observation has dramatic implications for the dynamics causing
  \"reluctant synchrony breaking'' when bifurcating solutions lie close to a
  non-robust synchrony space. The goal of this talk is to elucidate this
  staggering phenomenon. "
