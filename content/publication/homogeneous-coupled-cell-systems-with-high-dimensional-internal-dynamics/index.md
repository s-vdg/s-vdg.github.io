abstract: "The analysis of network dynamics is oftentimes restricted to networks
  with one-dimensional internal dynamics. Here, we show how symmetry explains
  the relation between behavior of systems with one-dimensional internal
  dynamics and with higher dimensional internal dynamics, when the network
  topology is the same. Fundamental networks of homogeneous coupled cell systems
  (B. Rink, J. Sanders. Coupled Cell Networks and Their Hidden Symmetries. SIAM
  J. Math. Anal. 46.2 (2014)) can be expressed in terms of monoid
  representations, which uniquely decompose into indecomposable
  subrepresentations. In the high-dimensional internal dynamics case, these
  subrepresentations are isomorphic to multiple copies of those one computes in
  the one-dimensional case. We describe the implications of this observation on
  steady state and Hopf bifurcations in  -parameter families of network vector
  fields. The main results are that (1) generic one-parameter steady state
  bifurcations are qualitatively independent of the dimension of the internal
  dynamics and that, (2) in order to observe all generic  -parameter
  bifurcations that may occur for internal dynamics of any dimension, the
  internal dynamics has to be at least  -dimensional for steady state
  bifurcations and  -dimensional for Hopf bifurcations. Furthermore, we
  illustrate how additional structure in the network can be exploited to obtain
  understanding beyond qualitative statements about the collective dynamics.
  One-parameter steady state bifurcations in feedforward networks exhibit an
  unusual amplification in the asymptotic growth rates of individual cells, when
  these are one-dimensional (S. von der Gracht, E. Nijholt, B. Rink. Amplified
  steady state bifurcations in feedforward networks. Nonlinearity 35.4 (2022)).
  We prove that (3) the same cells exhibit this amplifying effect with the same
  growth rates when the internal dynamics is high-dimensional. "
