abstract: We investigate bifurcations in feedforward coupled cell networks.
  Feedforward structure (the absence of feedback) can be defined by a partial
  order on the cells. We use this property to study generic one-parameter steady
  state bifurcations for such networks. Branching solutions and their
  asymptotics are described in terms of Taylor coefficients of the internal
  dynamics. They can be determined via an algorithm that only exploits the
  network structure. Similar to previous results on feedforward chains, we
  observe amplifications of the growth rates of steady state branches induced by
  the feedforward structure. However, contrary to these earlier results, as the
  interaction scenarios can be more complicated in general feedforward networks,
  different branching patterns and different amplifications can occur for
  different regions in the space of Taylor coefficients.
