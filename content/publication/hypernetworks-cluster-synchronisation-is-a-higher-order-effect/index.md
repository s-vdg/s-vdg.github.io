abstract: Many networked systems are governed by non-pairwise interactions
  between nodes. The resulting higher-order interaction structure can then be
  encoded by means of a hypernetwork. In this paper we consider dynamical
  systems on hypernetworks by defining a class of admissible maps for every such
  hypernetwork. We explain how to classify robust cluster synchronisation
  patterns on hypernetworks by finding balanced partitions, and we generalize
  the concept of a graph fibration to the hypernetwork context. We also show
  that robust synchronisation patterns are only fully determined by polynomial
  admissible maps of high order. This means that, unlike in dyadic networks,
  cluster synchronisation on hypernetworks is a higher-order, i.e., nonlinear
  effect. We give a formula, in terms of the order of the hypernetwork, for the
  degree of the polynomial admissible maps that determine robust synchronisation
  patterns. We also demonstrate that this degree is optimal by investigating a
  class of examples. We conclude by displaying how this effect may cause
  remarkable synchrony breaking bifurcations that occur at high polynomial
  degree.
