abstract: We present a novel method for high-order phase reduction in networks
  of weakly coupled oscillators and, more generally, perturbations of reducible
  normally hyperbolic (quasi-)periodic tori. Our method works by computing an
  asymptotic expansion for an embedding of the perturbed invariant torus, as
  well as for the reduced phase dynamics in local coordinates. Both can be
  determined to arbitrary degrees of accuracy, and we show that the phase
  dynamics may directly be obtained in normal form. We apply the method to
  predict remote synchronisation in a chain of coupled Stuart-Landau
  oscillators.
