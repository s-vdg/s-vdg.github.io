abstract: "Heteroclinic structures organize global features of dynamical
  systems. We analyze whether heteroclinic structures can arise in network
  dynamics with higher-order interactions which describe the nonlinear
  interactions between three or more units. We find that while commonly analyzed
  model equations such as network dynamics on undirected hypergraphs may be
  useful to describe local dynamics such as cluster synchronization, they give
  rise to obstructions that allow to design heteroclinic structures in phase
  space. By contrast, directed hypergraphs break the homogeneity and lead to
  vector fields that support heteroclinic structures. "
