abstract: Heteroclinic structures organize global features of dynamical systems.
  We analyse whether heteroclinic structures can arise in network dynamics with
  higher-order interactions which describe the nonlinear interactions between
  three or more units. We find that while commonly analysed model equations such
  as network dynamics on undirected hypergraphs may be useful to describe local
  dynamics such as cluster synchronization, they give rise to obstructions that
  allow to design of heteroclinic structures in phase space. By contrast,
  directed hypergraphs break the homogeneity and lead to vector fields that
  support heteroclinic structures.
