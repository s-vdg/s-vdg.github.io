abstract: To model dynamical systems on networks with higher order
  (non-pairwise) interactions, we recently introduced a new class of ODEs on
  hypernetworks. Here we consider one-parameter synchrony breaking bifurcations
  in such ODEs. We call a synchrony breaking steady state branch "reluctant" if
  it is tangent to a synchrony space, but does not lie inside it. We prove that
  reluctant synchrony breaking is ubiquitous in hypernetwork systems, by
  constructing a large class of examples that support it. We also give an
  explicit formula for the order of tangency to the synchrony space of a
  reluctant steady state branch.
