abstract: "In this paper we continue the study of group representations which
  are counterexamples to the Ize conjecture. As in previous papers we find new
  infinite series of finite groups leading to such counterexamples. These new
  series are quite different from the previous ones, for example the group
  orders do not form an arithmetic progression. However, as before we find Lie
  groups which contain all these groups. This additional structure was observed,
  but not used in the previous studies of this problem. Here we also investigate
  the related bifurcations. To a large extent, these are closely related to the
  presence of mentioned compact Lie group containing the finite groups. This
  might give a tool to study the bifurcations related to all low dimensional
  counterexamples of the Ize conjecture. It also gives an indication of where we
  can expect to find examples where the bifurcation behaviour is different from
  what we have seen in the known examples. "
