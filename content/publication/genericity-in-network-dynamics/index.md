abstract: "This thesis deals with the investigation of dynamical properties – in
  particular generic synchrony breaking bifurcations – that are inherent to the
  structure of a semigroup network as well the numerous algebraic structures
  that are related to these types of networks. Most notably we investigate the
  interplay between network dynamics and monoid representation theory as induced
  by the fundamental network construction in terms of hidden symmetry as
  introduced by RINK and SANDERS. After providing a brief survey of the field of
  network dynamics in Part I, we thoroughly introduce the formalism of semigroup
  networks, the customized dynamical systems theory, and the necessary
  background from monoid representation theory in Chapters 3 and 4. The
  remainder of Part II investigates generic synchrony breaking bifurcations and
  contains three major results. The first is Theorem 5.11, which shows that
  generic symmetry breaking steady state bifurcations in monoid equivariant
  dynamics occur along absolutely indecomposable subrepresentations – a natural
  generalization of the corresponding statement for group equivariant dynamics.
  Then Theorem 7.12 relates the decomposition of a representation given by a
  network with high-dimensional internal phase spaces to that induced by the
  same network with one-dimensional internal phase spaces. This result is used
  to show that there is a smallest dimension of internal dynamics in which all
  generic l-parameter bifurcations of a fundamental network can be observed
  (Theorem 7.24). In Part III, we employ the machinery that was summarized and
  further developed in Part II to feedforward networks. We propose a general
  definition of this structural feature of a network and show that it can
  equivalently be characterized in different algebraic notions in Theorem 8.35.
  These are then exploited to fully classify the corresponding monoid
  representation for any feedforward network and to classify generic synchrony
  breaking steady state bifurcations with one- or highdimensional internal
  dynamics. "
