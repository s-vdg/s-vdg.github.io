abstract: "We prove that steady state bifurcations in finite-dimensional
  dynamical systems that are symmetric with respect to a monoid representation
  generically occur along an absolutely indecomposable subrepresentation. This
  is stated as a conjecture in [B. Rink and J. Sanders, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 46
  (2014), pp. 1577--1609]. It is a generalization of the well-known fact that
  generic steady state bifurcations in equivariant dynamical systems occur along
  an absolutely irreducible subrepresentation if the symmetries form a
  group---finite or compact Lie. Our generalization also includes noncompact
  symmetry groups. The result has applications in bifurcation theory of
  homogeneous coupled cell networks as they can be embedded (under mild
  additional assumptions) into monoid equivariant systems. "
