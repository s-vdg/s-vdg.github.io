abstract: In this article we investigate the convergence behavior of gathering
  protocols with fixed circulant topologies using tools form dynamical systems.
  Given a fixed number of mobile entities moving in the Euclidean plane, we
  model a gathering protocol as a system of ordinary differential equations
  whose equilibria are exactly all possible gathering points. Then, we find
  necessary and sufficient conditions for the structure of the underlying
  interaction graph such that the protocol is stable and converging, i.e.,
  gathering, in the distributive computing sense by using tools from dynamical
  systems. Moreover, these tools allow for a more fine grained analysis in terms
  of speed of convergence in the dynamical systems sense. In fact, we derive a
  decomposition of the state space into stable invariant subspaces with
  different convergence rates. In particular, this decomposition is identical
  for every (linear) circulant gathering protocol, whereas only the convergence
  rates depend on the weights in interaction graph itself.
