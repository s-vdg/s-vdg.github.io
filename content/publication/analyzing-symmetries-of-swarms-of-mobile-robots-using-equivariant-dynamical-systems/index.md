  <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> this article, we investigate
  symmetry properties of distributed systems of mobile robots.

  We consider a swarm of $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ robots in the $\\mathcal{OBLOT}$ model and analyze their collective $\\mathcal{F}\\mathrm{sync}$ dynamics using equivariant dynamical systems theory.

  To this end, we show that the corresponding evolution function commutes with rotational and reflective transformations of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. These form a group that is isomorphic to $\\mathbf{O}(2) \\times S\_n$, the product group of the orthogonal group and the permutation on $n$ elements.

  The theory of equivariant dynamical systems is used to deduce a hierarchy along which symmetries of a robot swarm can potentially increase following an arbitrary protocol.

  By decoupling the $\\textsc{Look}$ phase from the \Compute/ and \Move/ phases in the mathematical description of an \LCM/ cycle, this hierarchy can be characterized in terms of automorphisms of connectivity graphs. 

  In particular, we find all possible types of symmetry increase, if the decoupled \Compute/ and \Move/ phase is invertible. 

  Finally, we apply our results to protocols which induce state-dependent linear dynamics, where the reduced system consisting of only the \Compute/ and \Move/ phase is linear.
