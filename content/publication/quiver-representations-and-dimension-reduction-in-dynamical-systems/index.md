abstract: "Dynamical systems often admit geometric properties that must be taken
  into account when studying their behavior. We show that many such properties
  can be encoded by means of quiver representations. These properties include
  classical symmetry, hidden symmetry, and feedforward structure, as well as
  subnetwork and quotient relations in network dynamical systems. A quiver
  equivariant dynamical system consists of a collection of dynamical systems
  with maps between them that send solutions to solutions. We prove that such
  quiver structures are preserved under Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction, center
  manifold reduction, and normal form reduction. "
