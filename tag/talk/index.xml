The aim of the workshop is to create an opportunity for researchers in network dynamical systems working in (Northern) Germany to connect, to regularly meet, and to exchange ideas. The meeting is intended to be the first in a regular series of symposia which will take place at WIAS, University of Hamburg and, potentially, also other places.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Talk: Model independent features and dimension reduction of network dynamical systems</title><link>https://s-vdg.github.io/talk/talk-model-independent-features-and-dimension-reduction-of-network-dynamical-systems/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 14:00:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s-vdg.github.io/talk/talk-model-independent-features-and-dimension-reduction-of-network-dynamical-systems/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
