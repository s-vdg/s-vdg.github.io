Countless works in recent years have highlighted how this structural feature crucially shapes the collective behavior. The higher order interaction structure can be encoded by means of a hypergraph or hypernetwork. This talk will focus on dynamics of such hypernetworks. We observe that simple model equations give rise to obstructions to the design of some heteroclinic structures in phase space when the interactions are undirected, whereas their directed counterparts do not. This leads us to define a very general class of directed hypernetworks and corresponding maps that respect a given interaction structure, so-called admissible maps. For this class, all robust patterns of (cluster) synchrony that a given hypernetwork supports can be classified. Interestingly, these are only determined by higher degree polynomial admissible maps. In particular, unlike in classical networks, cluster synchronization is a higher order, i.e., nonlinear effect. This feature induces a novel type of “reluctant” synchrony breaking bifurcation when a high order tangency of the solution branch to a non-robust synchrony space causes formerly synchronous nodes to separate unusually slowly as exemplified in the figure.","tags":null,"title":"Talk: Reluctant Synchrony Breaking in Directed Hypernetworks","type":"event"},{"authors":["Raphael Gerlach","Sören von der Gracht","Michael Dellnitz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1741682825,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1741682825,"objectID":"d155b317524308f02b14e10c3ed6cb39","permalink":"https://s-vdg.github.io/publication/on-the-dynamical-hierarchy-in-gathering-protocols-with-circulant-topologies/","publishdate":"2025-03-11T08:47:05.908Z","relpermalink":"/publication/on-the-dynamical-hierarchy-in-gathering-protocols-with-circulant-topologies/","section":"publication","summary":"In this article, we investigate the convergence behavior of two classes of gathering protocols with fixed circulant topologies using tools from dynamical systems.

For a circulant topology, we derive a decomposition of the state space into stable invariant subspaces with different convergence rates. This decomposition is identical for every linear circulant gathering protocol. Only the convergence rates depend on the weights in the interaction graph. In the second part, we consider a normalized nonlinear version of the equation of motion that is obtained by scaling the speed of each entity.

The robots' simplicity imply a strong limitation: When the initial configuration is rotationally symmetric, only patterns with a similar symmetry can be formed [Yamashita, Suzyuki; TCS 2010]. The only known algorithm to form large patterns with limited visibility and without memory requires the robots to start in a near-gathering (a swarm of constant diameter) [Hahn et al.; SAND 2024]. However, not only do we not know any near-gathering algorithm guaranteed to preserve symmetry but most natural gathering strategies trivially increase symmetries [Castenow et al.; OPODIS 2022].\nThus, we study near-gathering without changing the swarm's rotational symmetry for disoriented, oblivious robots with limited visibility (the OBLOT-model, see [Flocchini et al.; 2019]). We introduce a technique based on the theory of dynamical systems to analyze how a given algorithm affects symmetry and provide sufficient conditions for symmetry preservation. Until now, it was unknown whether the considered OBLOT-model allows for any non-trivial algorithm that always preserves symmetry. Our first result shows that a variant of Go-to-the-Average always preserves symmetry but may sometimes lead to multiple, unconnected near-gathering clusters. Our second result is a symmetry-preserving near-gathering algorithm that works on swarms with a convex boundary (the outer boundary of the unit disc graph) and without holes (circles of diameter 1 inside the boundary without any robots).

Such strategies consist of protocols run by the individual robots. They are supposed to guide the movements of the robots in such a way that globally a prescribed formation like gathering, forming a line or other shapes is reached from an arbitrary initial configuration of the robots. This research direction is well-established in distributed computing. Our approach is to combine techniques from distributed computing and dynamical systems research in order to enhance the understanding of protocols for such formation tasks. To this end, we analyze the speed of the protocols in terms of runtime complexity in the distributed computing sense as well as stability properties of the prescribed formation with the use of ideas from dynamical systems. While in the distributed computing community often only a worst-case analysis is considered, the tools of dynamical systems allow a more fine-grained analysis of the input configurations by exploring the state space. More concretely, the state space foliation describes the long-term dynamical behavior of input configurations in more detail, i.e. it allows to identify classes of configurations that converge comparably fast or slow and even classes that fail to converge to the prescribed formation.

We show that many such properties can be encoded by means of quiver representations. These properties include classical symmetry, hidden symmetry, and feedforward structure, as well as subnetwork and quotient relations in network dynamical systems. A quiver equivariant dynamical system consists of a collection of dynamical systems with maps between them that send solutions to solutions. We prove that such quiver structures are preserved under Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction, center manifold reduction, and normal form reduction.

Most notably we investigate the interplay between network dynamics and monoid representation theory as induced by the fundamental network construction in terms of hidden symmetry as introduced by RINK and SANDERS. After providing a brief survey of the field of network dynamics in Part I, we thoroughly introduce the formalism of semigroup networks, the customized dynamical systems theory, and the necessary background from monoid representation theory in Chapters 3 and 4. The remainder of Part II investigates generic synchrony breaking bifurcations and contains three major results. The first is Theorem 5.11, which shows that generic symmetry breaking steady state bifurcations in monoid equivariant dynamics occur along absolutely indecomposable subrepresentations – a natural generalization of the corresponding statement for group equivariant dynamics. Then Theorem 7.12 relates the decomposition of a representation given by a network with high-dimensional internal phase spaces to that induced by the same network with one-dimensional internal phase spaces. This result is used to show that there is a smallest dimension of internal dynamics in which all generic l-parameter bifurcations of a fundamental network can be observed (Theorem 7.24). In Part III, we employ the machinery that was summarized and further developed in Part II to feedforward networks. We propose a general definition of this structural feature of a network and show that it can equivalently be characterized in different algebraic notions in Theorem 8.35. These are then exploited to fully classify the corresponding monoid representation for any feedforward network and to classify generic synchrony breaking steady state bifurcations with one- or highdimensional internal dynamics.

This is stated as a conjecture in [B. Rink and J. Sanders, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 46 (2014), pp. 1577--1609]. It is a generalization of the well-known fact that generic steady state bifurcations in equivariant dynamical systems occur along an absolutely irreducible subrepresentation if the symmetries form a group---finite or compact Lie. Our generalization also includes noncompact symmetry groups. The result has applications in bifurcation theory of homogeneous coupled cell networks as they can be embedded (under mild additional assumptions) into monoid equivariant systems.

As in previous papers we find new infinite series of finite groups leading to such counterexamples. These new series are quite different from the previous ones, for example the group orders do not form an arithmetic progression. However, as before we find Lie groups which contain all these groups. This additional structure was observed, but not used in the previous studies of this problem. Here we also investigate the related bifurcations. To a large extent, these are closely related to the presence of mentioned compact Lie group containing the finite groups. This might give a tool to study the bifurcations related to all low dimensional counterexamples of the Ize conjecture. It also gives an indication of where we can expect to find examples where the bifurcation behaviour is different from what we have seen in the known examples.
