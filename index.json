Recently, there has been tremendous interest in simultaneous interactions between three or more units, so-called higher-order interactions. The drive comes from various disciplines, for example ecology, where simultaneous competition for resources of multiple species causes nonstationary fluctuations of species abundancies. Such advances suggest to model the underlying structures by hypernetworks represented by hypergraphs.

Given a fixed number of mobile entities moving in the Euclidean plane, we model a gathering protocol as a system of ordinary differential equations whose equilibria are exactly all possible gathering points. Then, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the structure of the underlying interaction graph such that the protocol is stable and converging, i.e., gathering, in the distributive computing sense by using tools from dynamical systems. Moreover, these tools allow for a more fine grained analysis in terms of speed of convergence in the dynamical systems sense. In fact, we derive a decomposition of the state space into stable invariant subspaces with different convergence rates. In particular, this decomposition is identical for every (linear) circulant gathering protocol, whereas only the convergence rates depend on the weights in interaction graph itself.","tags":["dynamical systems","coupled systems","distributed computing","robot swarms","autonomous mobile robots","gathering"],"title":"On the Dynamical Hierarchy in Gathering Protocols with Circulant Topologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The goal of this project is to investigate the capabilities and limitations of local, distributed strategies for swarms of mobile robots. Such strategies consist of protocols run by the individual robots. They are supposed to guide the movements of the robots in such a way that globally a prescribed formation like gathering, forming a line or other shapes is reached from an arbitrary initial configuration of the robots. This research direction is well-established in distributed computing. Our approach is to combine techniques from distributed computing and dynamical systems research in order to enhance the understanding of protocols for such formation tasks. To this end, we analyze the speed of the protocols in terms of runtime complexity in the distributed computing sense as well as stability properties of the prescribed formation with the use of ideas from dynamical systems. While in the distributed computing community often only a worst-case analysis is considered, the tools of dynamical systems allow a more fine-grained analysis of the input configurations by exploring the state space. More concretely, the state space foliation describes the long-term dynamical behavior of input configurations in more detail, i.e. it allows to identify classes of configurations that converge comparably fast or slow and even classes that fail to converge to the prescribed formation.

Not only are they a timely and fascinating field of and the cornerstone of Artificial Intelligence (AI) but they also provide application examples in a natural way on which the main concepts of Linear Algebra can be explained.\nIn this project, the foundations of Linear Algebra will be developed at the hand of a Neural Networks problem. This generates a fundamental and critical understanding of their mode of operation and illustrates the power of Linear Algebra as a tool.\nIt is important that learners develop their own position towards the “future technology” AI that allows them to critically question the realistic range of developing applications.\nAnalog zum OMB+/ViaMint Projekt der MintFit-AG der Hamburger Hochschulen, das sich an Studienbewerber richtet, wird eine interaktive Selbstlerneinheit zur Linearen Algebra, aufbauend auf mathematischem Schulwissen, konzipiert und implementiert.

The resulting higher-order interaction structure can then be encoded by means of a hypernetwork. In this paper we consider dynamical systems on hypernetworks by defining a class of admissible maps for every such hypernetwork. We explain how to classify robust cluster synchronisation patterns on hypernetworks by finding balanced partitions, and we generalize the concept of a graph fibration to the hypernetwork context. We also show that robust synchronisation patterns are only fully determined by polynomial admissible maps of high order. This means that, unlike in dyadic networks, cluster synchronisation on hypernetworks is a higher-order, i.e., nonlinear effect. We give a formula, in terms of the order of the hypernetwork, for the degree of the polynomial admissible maps that determine robust synchronisation patterns. We also demonstrate that this degree is optimal by investigating a class of examples. We conclude by displaying how this effect may cause remarkable synchrony breaking bifurcations that occur at high polynomial degree.","tags":["coupled systems","bifurcation theory","network dynamics","higher order interactions","hypernetworks"],"title":"Hypernetworks: cluster synchronisation is a higher-order effect","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sören von der Gracht","Eddie Nijholt","Bob Rink"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"","date":1646648572,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646648572,"objectID":"7572c2b65452834284e8f2fd1eaae5d0","permalink":"https://s-vdg.github.io/publication/amplified-steady-state-bifurcations-in-feedforward-networks/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T10:22:52.965Z","relpermalink":"/publication/amplified-steady-state-bifurcations-in-feedforward-networks/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate bifurcations in feedforward coupled cell networks.

Most notably we investigate the interplay between network dynamics and monoid representation theory as induced by the fundamental network construction in terms of hidden symmetry as introduced by RINK and SANDERS. After providing a brief survey of the field of network dynamics in Part I, we thoroughly introduce the formalism of semigroup networks, the customized dynamical systems theory, and the necessary background from monoid representation theory in Chapters 3 and 4. The remainder of Part II investigates generic synchrony breaking bifurcations and contains three major results. The first is Theorem 5.11, which shows that generic symmetry breaking steady state bifurcations in monoid equivariant dynamics occur along absolutely indecomposable subrepresentations – a natural generalization of the corresponding statement for group equivariant dynamics. Then Theorem 7.12 relates the decomposition of a representation given by a network with high-dimensional internal phase spaces to that induced by the same network with one-dimensional internal phase spaces. This result is used to show that there is a smallest dimension of internal dynamics in which all generic l-parameter bifurcations of a fundamental network can be observed (Theorem 7.24). In Part III, we employ the machinery that was summarized and further developed in Part II to feedforward networks. We propose a general definition of this structural feature of a network and show that it can equivalently be characterized in different algebraic notions in Theorem 8.35. These are then exploited to fully classify the corresponding monoid representation for any feedforward network and to classify generic synchrony breaking steady state bifurcations with one- or highdimensional internal dynamics.

This is stated as a conjecture in [B. Rink and J. Sanders, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 46 (2014), pp. 1577--1609]. It is a generalization of the well-known fact that generic steady state bifurcations in equivariant dynamical systems occur along an absolutely irreducible subrepresentation if the symmetries form a group---finite or compact Lie. Our generalization also includes noncompact symmetry groups. The result has applications in bifurcation theory of homogeneous coupled cell networks as they can be embedded (under mild additional assumptions) into monoid equivariant systems.

As in previous papers we find new infinite series of finite groups leading to such counterexamples. These new series are quite different from the previous ones, for example the group orders do not form an arithmetic progression. However, as before we find Lie groups which contain all these groups. This additional structure was observed, but not used in the previous studies of this problem. Here we also investigate the related bifurcations. To a large extent, these are closely related to the presence of mentioned compact Lie group containing the finite groups. This might give a tool to study the bifurcations related to all low dimensional counterexamples of the Ize conjecture. It also gives an indication of where we can expect to find examples where the bifurcation behaviour is different from what we have seen in the known examples.
